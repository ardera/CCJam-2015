My entry for CCJam 2015.

A OOP library that features:
	inheritance (of course)
	static types (-> no type checking for function arguments; variable types still possible)
	a big callstack (based on the fact that every coroutine can have it's own 256calls sized callstack -> 50*256 = 10496 calls height)
	enums
	executable class archives (like jar files in java)
	operator overloading
